\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$Fn... I\-D\-S$>$union Promise\-Union$<$ I\-D\-S $>$}

The {\ttfamily \hyperlink{unionPromiseUnion}{Promise\-Union}} template union defines a union over the set of types corresponding to the list of input {\ttfamily Fn} values. Furthermore, instances of this template provides member template functions that allow for casting between each type as well as evaluating content data by a given function.

The {\ttfamily cast()} template function, when called with a {\ttfamily Fn} template parameter contained by the union type, casts the contents of the union to the corresponding type and returns the reference.

The {\ttfamily rigid\-\_\-eval()} template function, when called with a program class and `\-Fn' value as template parameters, calls the corresponding async function for the corresponding program class on the union contents.

The {\ttfamily loose\-\_\-eval()} template function operates like the {\ttfamily rigid\-\_\-eval()} template function, except that the {\ttfamily Fn} value is passed as a function argument, rather than as a template argument. 

The documentation for this union was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
